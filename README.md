# Mythic Spawn Protect
Disables or Deletes The Following;
* Blacklisted Car Models
* Blacklist Ped Models
* Scenarios
* Weapon Drops From Peds
* Some Car Gens (Honestly don't remember all of the ones that I added to remove, was done a long time ago. I know for sure at least PDM was in there)

> Note: Due to the pure nature of what this is doing, the performance is somewhat crap. Can spike > 0.10ms execution time due to the fact that some of these things have to be done nearly every frame (weapon drops) or having to iterate through a bunch off entities (Cars & Peds)
